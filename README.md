# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects.

This repository is a personal log of my learning journey in data science and machine learning. Iâ€™m currently committing at least **one completed project every two weeks** as a way to practice, document what Iâ€™ve learned, and build toward mastery.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
Each project here is meant to reflect:
- Concepts Iâ€™ve studied and implemented
- Practical application of ML techniques
- Growth in Machine Learning, MLOps, Deep Learning and more

Iâ€™m still learning and experimenting â€” thereâ€™s a long way to go â€” but this repo keeps me accountable and helps track progress over time.

## ðŸš€ Project Frequency
- New project: **Every 2 weeks (minimum)**
- Focus: clarity, functionality, and learning â€” not perfection
